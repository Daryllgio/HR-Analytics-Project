HR-Analytics-Project

Project Overview:
This is an end-to-end data analytics project focused on developing a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard to help businesses monitor employee attrition and other key HR metrics. The project involved data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using a variety of tools to provide actionable insights.

Problem Statement:
A key challenge for Human Resources departments is understanding and mitigating employee attrition. 

This project aims to answer critical questions such as:
- What is the current employee attrition rate?
- Which departments and age groups have the highest attrition?
- How does job satisfaction correlate with attrition?
- What is the distribution of employees by gender, marital status, and education level?

Key Findings and Insights:
- Attrition is highest among employees aged 25-34 and those with a Bachelor's Degree. This suggests specific targeting for retention strategies.
- Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives show the highest attrition counts, indicating a need for role-specific interventions.
- Male employees make up a larger percentage (60%) of the total workforce, while attrition is relatively balanced between genders.
- Job Satisfaction is highest in the Manufacturing Director role (average rating of 3.25), while Sales Representatives have the lowest average satisfaction.
- Single employees have a significantly higher attrition rate compared to their married or divorced counterparts.

Technical Skills and Tools Used
  1) Data Cleaning & Analysis:
      - SQL (PostgreSQL): Used to write complex queries to test and validate dashboard components, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. Queries included GROUP BY, JOIN, CROSSTAB, and aggregate functions.
      - Excel: Utilized Power Query for initial data transformation and a smaller, dynamic dashboard for key metrics.

  2) Data Visualization & Business Intelligence:
     - Tableau: Developed an interactive, comprehensive dashboard to visualize key HR metrics, allowing stakeholders to filter data and gain insights in real-time.
     - Excel: A separate, interactive dashboard was built in Excel to showcase key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.
